Our group will evaluate the correlation between number of concussions in the NFL since the Will Smith movie “Concussion” was released in 2015. We will gather data on injuries and rule changes during that time period. 

###Questions to be answered:

Did rule changes affect all injuries or just concussions?
*Alt: If injuries were affected by rule changes, then injuries would go down.
*Null: If injuries were not affected by rule changes, then injuries would not go down.

Did teams that performed better have less concussions?
*Alt: If teams have a record above .500, then they would have less concussions.
*Null: If teams do not have a record above .500, then they would not have less concussions.

Is there a certain time of year that has more concussions occur?
*Alt: If the time of year affects concussions, then there will be more concussions during a certain part of the season.

# ConcussionGroupA

### Overview:
Our group will evaluate the correlation between number of concussions in the NFL since the Will Smith movie “Concussion” was released in 2015. We will gather data on injuries and rule changes during that time period. 

### Questions to be answered:
1. Did the movie decrease the amount of concussions?
* Alt: If the movie concussion had an effect on the NFL, then concussion injuries would go down during the 2016 season.
* Null: If the movie concussion had no effect on the NFL, then concussion injuries would not go down during the 2016 season.

2. Did rule changes affect all injuries or just concussions?
* Alt: If injuries were affected by rule changes, then injuries would go down.
* Null: If injuries were not affected by rule changes, then injuries would not go down.

3. Is there a certain time of year that has more concussions occur?
* Alt: If the time of year affects concussions, then there will be more concussions during a certain part of the season. 
* Null: If the time of year does not affect concussions, then there will not be more concussions during a certain part of the season.

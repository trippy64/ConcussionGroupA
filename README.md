# ConcussionGroupA

Overview:
Our group will evaluate the correlation between number of concussions in the NFL since the Will Smith movie “Concussion” was released in 2015. We will gather data on injuries and rule changes during that time period. 

Questions to be answered:
Did the movie decrease or increase the amount of concussions?
Did rule changes lower the amount of concussions?
Did teams that performed better have less concussions?
Is there a certain time of year that has more concussions occur?
